# Wiki_Scraping

Initially the project is basic Web Scraping using Python Language.

## Idea

In this project we are scrapping basic data of different colleges or schools as per the users need from wikipedia.
[Default Web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology)

## Code

Committed code is scrapping the Motto of MIT. Later on we can enhance the code in such a way that it may be able to fetch any data from
wikipedia of any college, school or organizations as per user need.

## Remaining Enhancements

- Basic GUI
- User input about the organization
- Multiple options asking about the college, schools or organization like fees, employers, etc
